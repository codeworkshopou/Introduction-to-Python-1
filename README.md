# Introduction-to-Python-1

This course is developed by McKenna Burns at Miami University and CODE workshop at the University of Oklahoma.


This is an introductory course with all the tools necessary for you to write your first code with python. 

You will need to install Python from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/  - This is the plain installer where you can use a simple interface to run your scripts. If you would like to potentially use another interface that has more organization functions, then install Python using the installer Ananconda here https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution, where JupyterLab (https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/basic-tasks/apps/use-jupyterlab/) will automatically also be installed.  


Please email us if you encounter any issues with your installation or if you have any questions at codeworkshopou@gmail.com
